How it works
GCP operates on a public cloud model, meaning its resources are available over the internet to multiple organizations and individuals who pay for the services they use.
It provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) options.
Users can access and manage these services through a web-based console or APIs to run applications, store data, and leverage advanced technologies like machine learning.
